# Jahra'a High School Admin

Jahra'a High School Admin is a school management system designed to streamline administrative tasks and improve the overall efficiency of school operations. Built with Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, this application offers features such as attendance tracking, weekly schedule generation, student-carer relationship management, and score management.

This application was inspired by my experiences at Aljahra'a Alahlya High School in Kuwait and is designed to meet the needs of similar educational institutions. While it is tailored to my high school, it can be adapted for use in other schools across Kuwait.
